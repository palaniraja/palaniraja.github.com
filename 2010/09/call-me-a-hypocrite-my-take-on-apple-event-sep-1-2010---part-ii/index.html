<h3 id="itunes-10">iTunes 10</h3>

<p>Another iTunes upgrade, I don&rsquo;t want to see another 100Mb iTunes upgrade till next month. Many people were fighting over the icon, Guys! they have changed the boring icon after a decade.</p>

<p>And one more social networking and it is specifically for Music. I wonder why don&rsquo;t you guys just tweet instead of inventing new social networking for music?</p>

<p>I guess it is because you can create a Twitter clone in an hour. And you add try to gain the market share by adding bloated features for your lifetime.</p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t organize tweets by events/purchase/post try Tumblr. I agree Facebook sucks!</p>

<p>Moreover we call frequent purchase log/liked it tweet as SPAM and you call it Ping. I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;ll ever sign-in for ping.</p>

<p>A new list view layout added. Which removes the repeated Album title and replace with Album title &amp; Album art. Hmm it took almost a decade for Apple to design.</p>

<p>I remember doing similar stuff when I designed a report meant for printing in 2005. I skip the repeated text in next row of same column. I&rsquo;ve also skipped printing 0 in quantity column. I didn&rsquo;t patent it :)</p>

<p>And one more thing, the UI for iTunes store welcome screen sucks at-least the blue section header, please do something about it.</p>

<p>He talked about the custom Top 10 chart. Because the current rating &amp; algorithm sucks. And all the people learnt a lesson from Google i.e., the more data you log from a user the more accurate you are. The custom Top 10 charts could be using same algorithm of our good old shopping cart application&rsquo;s &ldquo;People who bought this also bought the following&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="apple-tv">Apple TV</h3>

<p>Seems like the 2nd generation iPod nano was modified to be used as remote. Jobs certainly pointed some valid issues with TV like Syncing/Storage but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that what they have is the best solution. You can only stream! This itself is a big disadvantage. Streaming or consuming more bandwidth itself a pain and not a green way of doing it.</p>

<p>I know many fellow people stream Youtube videos on high-res (360p) even for the text only songs. And always I wish there exists an audio only Youtube. Not all the videos worth streaming in high-quality.</p>

<p>You cost more bandwidth and there exists consequences of consuming more resources and I&rsquo;m certainly not happy and many would agree that.</p>

<p>There were no applause for HD price. I am sick of the applauses, Steve almost pause for the Apple Fanboys to express their gratitude towards his masterpiece, well his masterpieces but it is really annoying when they go crazy for silly updates.</p>

<p>But there were pin-drop silence when he announced the HD Movie rental price I do not have any idea why. I was only proud to see &ldquo;She is out of my league&rdquo; poster in the screen. Nice movie and I recommend it for all.</p>

<p>Last but not the least, I noticed the black cable connected to iPad. Genuine? or you guys bought it after the original cable was torn down.</p>

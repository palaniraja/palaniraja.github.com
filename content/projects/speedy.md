Speedy is a Speed reading application for Mac OS X that lets you speed read the text contents.  

It is based on speed reading technique/methodology called [Spritz](http://spritzinc.com/the-science)

> Spritzing presents reading content one word at a time with the ORP  “Optimal Recognition Point”, positioned inside of our custom "redicle". Within the redicle are special prompts that keep your eyes focused on the ORP , allowing you to read without the need to move your eyes. 
  
I created to read the emails & news faster, as I have a tendency to lost in ['endless space between the words'](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/quotes?item=qt2085733) with my lack of concentration or I should say gift of imagination?  
  
To use the app Speedy, select text you want to speed read and choose Speedy from "Services" menu or using global shortcut `CMD + SHIFT + E`. Or you can also `CMD + v` to speed read clipboard content.

You can increase or decrease the speed by using your UP or DOWN arrow keys & SPACE to pause and unpause. It saves your WPM (Words per minute) preference and use it in subsequent launches.

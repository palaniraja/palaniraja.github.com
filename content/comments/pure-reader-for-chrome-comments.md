#### Five Stars - Makes Reader so much cleaner!

When I first saw this for Safari, I was hoping I could use it in FF...Thanks for your quick work porting this to FF. It mentioned in the description that FF users might have to do some additional tweaking, but having just installed this, it looks great; maybe I'll discover something after using it for a bit, but it seems to to work right "out of the box" for me.

Bitsplitting - Beautiful logo I have seen in a long time. I don't know how [@danielpunkass](https://twitter.com/danielpunkass) decided to use one version of the two. I couldn't decide which is the one I like the most.  
  
I also like his intro music of [Bitsplitting podcast](http://bitsplitting.org/podcast).

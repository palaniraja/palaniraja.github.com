Wish you all a very happy new year!  
  
It is 2013, another chance for us/me to start a new beginning. I believed in [Mayan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization) so much, I never had a plan post [20th Dec 2012](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/2012_apocalypse) :)  
  
I had a bad habit of logging what I call "project ideas".  Whenever I do a task where I believe I could make it better, I log them, hoping I will spend time to work on it as a side project. Here is partial screenshot of my list

I was listening to [Merlin Mann](http://5by5.tv/people/merlin-mann) recent episodes ([Episode 95 to 99](http://5by5.tv/b2w)), he tricked me to give [GTD-Getting things done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) another try.  
  
I guess I can atleast to do the first step, log all. Well, I have already logged them in [simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com/) / [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/), since I don't think I execute all, I am sharing it public to see if I can collaborate with other interested people.  
  
Some ideas are dead-on-arrival like the "Apple - Ping fail". Some are just problems I don't know the solution yet.  
  
By the way, I didn't say I have million dollar idea :-) Let me see how it goes.

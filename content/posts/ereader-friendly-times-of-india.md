### What does it do?

It is a PHP script that helps you to convert Times of India (Daily newspaper) to EPUB.

There is a great open source utility [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) which can convert any RSS to EPUB. But I prefer to have exact content what I see in the daily. Eg., I read only selected section like Front page, International, Sport.

Times of India allows you to download Complete PDF version which is very large, close to 300Mb. I did a quick search to see if there is any ebook version available but the results are negative.

But they do have a mpaper which allows you to browse exact navigation of their printed copy. Unfortuntely their mPaper version is not organized such a way we can customize it for ebook readers with Userstyles or Userscripts.

This particular tool/script parse mPaper content and converts the content to EPUB, which can be used with ebook reader devices like Nook, iPad/iPhone, Sony Reader, Kindle (no native support) etc.,  
  
Here is the sample EPUB with articles of first 5 pages (Aug 16 - [http://bit.ly/c9upKD](http://bit.ly/c9upKD) Aug 17 - [http://bit.ly/9J7FJ9](http://bit.ly/9J7FJ9)).  
  
Need to fix some issues like formatting, inline images, organize articles by section instead of page and CSS.  
  
I'm planning to **open source** the prj for other interested people to work on it.  
  
Will post more details this weekend. Send me your feedbacks & ideas.

**P.S -**  The reason behind this is their mobile friendly website design is crappy and no alternative for ebook readers. Yep! first of its kind (Indian Daily available in EPUB) and I hope I’ll be able to host it somewhere soon for others to use it.

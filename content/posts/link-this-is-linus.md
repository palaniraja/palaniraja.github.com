Last week [Zite](http://zite.com/) suggested [this article](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/linus-torvalds-defends-his-right-to-shame-linux-kernel-developers/), I've known about Linus and his rude comments. But reading this article, I realised that being polite is not right solution for everything. Having the experience of working with the many developers over the years, I met only very few people who act on subtle comments I pass during discussion about code/best practices. The rest just ignore and do what they have always been doing.

> The fact is, people need to know what my position on things are. And I can't just say "please don't do that", because people won't listen. I say "On the internet, nobody can hear you being subtle," and I mean it.
>   
> Because if you want me to "act professional," I can tell you that I'm not interested. I'm sitting in my home office wearing a bathrobe. The same way I'm not going to start wearing ties, I'm \*also\* not going to buy into the fake politeness, the lying, the office politics and backstabbing, the passive aggressiveness, and the buzzwords. Because THAT is what "acting professionally" results in: people resort to all kinds of really nasty things because they are forced to act out their normal urges in unnatural ways.

  
At times you need to be [King Leonidas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Doik1_9ze5k) and kick them hard so they learn and do not repeat the mistake.

This is something I've started in Jan '[15](https://github.com/palaniraja/devdiary/commits/master). This is to practice a habit of keeping a log of stuff I do which took me a lot of time to figure out myself (may be I'm not efficient?).  
  
I'm getting old and everything seems to be aÂ [Dejavu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu). At times, I keep spending more time figuring out the same solution as I'm switching between projects & technologies often.  
  
Well, today I was re-working on my iPad app with a new [in-app purchase](http://www.palaniraja.com/devdiary/ios/inapp/inapp-purchase.html) and my own document helped me to quickly close the task.  
  
Irony is I started this DevDiary to log my learning of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) & [Flexbox](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) in Dec 2014. Which is not updated yet, may be someday. I wish to update the project in a weekly basis or at-least once a month.  
  
I built the DevDiary with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package called [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), which I've [documented](http://www.palaniraja.com/devdiary/gitbook/gitbook.html) for my own benefit.  
  
So if I may suggest, kindly keep your own log and it is very easy with Github & Gitbook.

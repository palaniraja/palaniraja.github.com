If you did not have enough time to go through the [50G contents](http://www.flickr.com/photos/palaniraja-mca/9149855356/) from WWDC'13, I highly recommend you to watch the session 228, aptly named "_Hidden Gems in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch_".

There were like 30+ tips, if you are interested my score, it is only 8.  
  
Third year in a row, I published the compiled list of sessions and [download links here](http://goo.gl/cXcHm). Note: You need iOS developer program credentials to download the files.

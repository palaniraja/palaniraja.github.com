I couldn't help myself after listening to [John & Marco discussion](http://atp.fm/episodes/8-hold-me) about the pricing of Panic's new app [Status Board](http://www.panic.com/statusboard/).  
  
I agree with the pricing of the app, who could deny John's reasoning? With all due respect,Â  a dedicated iPad just to display a dashboard? sounds like diamond studded car. It is a overkill and I would argue you ruining the destiny of your iPad. It deserves more care than hiding behind your old TV/Monitor.  
  
[Raspberry pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is the right candidate for this task, though I guess [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) is also cheaper solution, but from development perspective (I'm not sure, I have come across some nodejs modules), I would suggest to go with Raspberry Pi with [Html5](http://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com/sample) ([http://shopify.github.io/dashing/](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/)).  
  
Wish I could develop a quick prototype that is compatible with Panic api for [Raspberry Pi appstore](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-the-pi-store/).

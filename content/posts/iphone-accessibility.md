What if iPhone provides an accessibility option for users with bigger finger?

I found that pinch to zoom and screenshot capturing can be considered as good photo cropping tool. This was done in the following sequence screenshot + zoom + screenshot. You can see the same with the UIPageControl aligned little left instead of center.

And it also reminds me that a colleague of mine thought iPhone 3GS is 3G small. I hope this could be the picture that he had in his mind.

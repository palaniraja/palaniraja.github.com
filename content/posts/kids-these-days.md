Last weekend I was fortunate to be a technical evaluator of an hackathon. Yes, I'm trying to be vague here, as my company sponsored this event at a most reputed university of our state, Â this post is just my view.  
  
There were 9 team participated out of which 3 teams dropped off and only 5 were presented at the end of 48 hour hackathon.  
  
The funny thing is organizers of this programme was surprised that the students are completely prepared, I heard they didn't raise any question at the end of our opening speech. Their only worry was which of their idea can be executed within the given time which was a surprise for our team.  
  
All of their ideas are good, though I was aware of similar apps, I didn't share any of my feedback as I thought it might demotivate them as I only joined at the end of the hackathon. One of the team was thinking they are having next billion dollar idea, and they were referring themselves as a competitor to a famous site of their domain. I happen to agree, if they pitch to right people they could definitely make few millions.  
  
Kids are between 2nd-4th year of CS background. One of the team people actually left for like 4 hrs to participate in another programme. All of the participates already secured a 6 digit income per month :-)  
  
I was really impressed by their talents especially the knowledge of tools. All of them aware of native/hybrid mobile development and right framework. For eg., most of them developed app using [jQuery mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) and [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) to package, [codiqa](https://codiqa.com/) to get the UI up and running, and their knowledge in the plugins one of the team actually published their plugin in [GitHub](https://github.com/). Another team started with a [style guide](http://alistapart.com/article/creating-style-guides), only few of my project starts with a branding guidelines in my decade old professional experience.  
  
If I own a time machine and I'll travel back in time to kick myself in the butt for not getting high scores which could have changed my life. What can I say, I was, and still is a day dreamer.

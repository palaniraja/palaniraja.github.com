Ok. My first Greasemonkey script is available from [userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/) ([http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/9740](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/9740)) 

I have been using Greasemonkey for more than a year. Recently I downloaded 2 userscript, GMail superclean and Gmail air, which inspired me to write a script. 

Two days ago, I was assigned to do url rewriting for our free-classifieds site.Â  As usual I started googling and found a good site with online tools for url rewriting ([seochat.com](http://seochat.com/)), but the advertisement on the site annoyed me, since I was working with long urls. So, I created this script. Hope you will find this useful. It certainly helped me :)


**Update**: Replaced userscripts link with [http://userscripts-mirror.org](http://userscripts-mirror.org).  Installed 328 times.

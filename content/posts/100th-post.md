[Sachin Tendulkar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar): First to reach 200 runs in an ODI and 100 International centuries.

There have been many people who climbed Mt.Everest since [Edmund Hillary & Tenzing Norgay](http://history1900s.about.com/od/1950s/qt/mteverest.htm). How many of them you remember?

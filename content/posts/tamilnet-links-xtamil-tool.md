I'm overwhelmed with happiness after I saw my Google analytics report today. This blog and the new tool which I wrote [xTamil](http://palaniraja.12gbfree.com/xTamil "xTamil - English to Tamil unicode convertor") \- English to Tamil convertor (Unicode) are linked in a Tamil portal site [Tamil.net](http://www.tamil.net "Tamil.net"). They also list numerous no. of phonetic English to Tamil Unicode convertor, I promise you all that my tool will be unique after the completion (will take a month or two).

I would like to thank all of my friends for their encouragement. And also for the guys out there in Tamil.net for posting my tool in their site. 

**Thank you friends** :)

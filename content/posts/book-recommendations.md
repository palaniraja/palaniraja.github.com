I was too lazy to write blog post for a long time. To break my lazy streak, here is something I wanted to write and procrastinated for at-least 6 months.  

### [Becoming Steve Jobs - by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli](https://www.amazon.in/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-evolution-visionary-ebook/dp/B00P6URK66/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1521557660&sr=1-1&keywords=becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary)

I believe this is the fifth book I read about Steve or linked to Steve's life. I find his life is fascinating, full of inspirations; how one man can change the world.  
  
If you have already read the official biography by [Isaac](https://www.amazon.in/Steve-Jobs-Exclusive-Walter-Isaacson-ebook/dp/B005J3IEZQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) and want to re-read about Steve Jobs with different point of view, I would recommend this book. There are definitely some new things to learn about our beloved Steve from this book as well.  
  
Here is the summary about the need of the book by Time cook in addition to [Official Biography](https://www.amazon.in/Steve-Jobs-Exclusive-Walter-Isaacson-ebook/dp/B005J3IEZQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)  
  

> I thought the \[Walter\] Isaacson book did him a tremendous disservice. It was just a rehash of a bunch of stuff that had already been written, and focused on small parts of his personality. You get the feeling that \[Steve’s\] a greedy, selfish egomaniac. It didn’t capture the person. The person I read about there is somebody I would never have wanted to work with over all this time. Life is too short.

### [Born a Crime - by Trevor Noah](https://www.amazon.in/Born-Crime-Trevor-Noah/dp/1473635292)

This is something I got to know from [Bill Gates book recommendation](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Born-a-Crime). I knew Trevor as a The Daily show host as a Jon Stewart's successor and couple of Youtube standup comedy. But the endorsement from Mr.Gates inspired me to read this.  
  
I'm glad that I choose Audio book for this instead of Kindle version. I enjoyed a lot more than any book. Since it is narrated by Trevor himself. It felt like a standup and learn a lot about South Africa and his interesting upbringing and his life story.  
  
I kind of relate to some of his childhood as a boy who do not have access to computers, only access was using friends (who business was to sell pirated CDs) and early internet days.  
  
Also as an Indian, the only South African reference in our history is how Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as a lawyer who witnessed injustice in SA, awakened him to lead Indian freedom against British to become Mahatma Gandhi.  
  
I totally forgot that we share the common enemy British. So it is good to listen and hate British at the same time. When I was in UK and visiting museums and I always felt uneasy to see the stuffs they stole from India in display. This book reminds me that they stole from everywhere. At-least one reason to be happy about their Brexit failures (I listened this book POST [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit))  
  
If you choose to read this I strongly recommend listening as an [Audio Book](https://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/Born-a-Crime-Audiobook/B01IW9TQPK) you will enjoy.

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Chan">Jackie Chan</a> is the first action star I remember from my <em>childhood</em>. I know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee">Bruce Lee</a> and his fame but never seen his movies, coming to think of it, I do not remember if I have ever seen any one of his movie complete at all, to date. But I can remember so many scenes from my first Jackie Chan movie <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/who_am_i">Who am I</a> though I have never seen the movie after 1998.</p>

<p>I was go through Library&rsquo;s audiobooks application for any new ones and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Grow-Up-Jackie-Chan/dp/1982107219">this book</a> one caught my eye. I thought it would be a good opportunity to listen a non sci-fi or podcast for the week. I ended up completing this in the same weekend.</p>

<p>It was full of interesting and <em>honest</em> stories from his early life, struggles and hard-work. So many incidents from his life, his mistakes and regrets. Also he is point blank about his wealth and spending after all the fame and fortune. He also addressed his son&rsquo;s arrest which even I am aware of and I did not expect that in his memoir.</p>

<p>I always had respect Jackie for his dare-devil skills and he manages to earn more as a respectable and honest human.</p>

> **Update** (2016-01-20)**:** The app is now available on [Mac App store](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1076119164&mt=12).
  

  
Additional menu clock for your Mac. A minimalist clock to display time of different timezone of your choice.  
  
The app stays in menu bar all the time and you can customize the display format and timezone.

I was recently working on a calendar based iPad app project. The events are fetched from users [salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com/) data, since users data are in different timezone and requirement is that I should only display events between 8am-8pm.  
  
I set my macmini and device timezone to user timezone to test and develop.  I also liked to have another clock for my localtime. As I don't use writst watch and broken home button on my iPhone is driving me crazy to check my local time.  
  
I did search for free utilities and I didn't find one as I like to use. I hate to bring dashboard everytime and free apps available as floating windows sucks.

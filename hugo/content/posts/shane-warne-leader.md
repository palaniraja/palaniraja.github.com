Color me surprised, I was amazed by his replies. Here is my favourite one  
  

> _Harsha Bhogle_: What you strive to do as a leader? Understand people?  
>   
> _Shane Warne_: Look, it is a real difficult one sometimes, as captain, because you want to be their friend. I think it is important to be their friend and let them know. Because once you get their friendship and trust then you can talk direct and be honest with them. If you haven't really built up that trust, you can become a dictator. And there is a big difference between being a dictator and friend. It is a lot easier to accept criticism from you friend or a decision you may not like from a friend.  
>   
> But you still need to keep that distance as a captain and let them know that you are in charge.

Yes, every post you come across suggest the same thing, hold your power button and home button for X seconds. Though it is true, unfortunately I had a couple of situations my iphone doesn't respond to the key combinations. And some time it is very frustrating to hold your buttons so long.

Though [TinyUmbrella](http://thefirmwareumbrella.blogspot.com/)'s basic functionality is to save and restore SHSH blobs, it has the feature I was hoping for.  
  
No holding of Sleep/Wake and Home button required. One click to put your connected device to DFU Recovery mode and another to exit from DFU Recovery mode.

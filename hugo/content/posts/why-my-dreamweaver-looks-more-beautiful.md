I don’t find an alternative title. Like anyone out there, I envy Textmate features where it is present in all the screencasts for PHP & RoR out there. So, I started looking for a Textmate alternate on windows, and came to this post [Textmate envy](http://www.webdevkungfu.com/textmate-envy-aka-monaco-font-for-windows/ "Textmate Envy Monaco on Windows"). I tried the font Monaco (Textmate's default), which looked beautiful in [Firebug](http://www.getfirebug.com "Firebug") but not in Dreamweaver. Filled with dissapointment, I google again for a download for the font Monaco, then, eureka! I found this link, [Programmers font](http://www.openwatcom.org/index.php/Programmers_Fonts "Programmers fonts"). Which means, I am not alone, there are more people out there looking for the suitable replacement to Courier New (isn’t it time to change?). I have tried a few Monaca, Dejavu, Bitstream Vera.

Finally, I come to the conclusion that [Anonymous](http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html "Download font Anonymous") font certainly isn't anonymous any more. It looks better than Monaca in windows, look at my screenshot. Today I hardly wrote any code, and spent more time on looking at my dreamweaver, its awesome!!.

A colleague told me that I should be a QA Engineer in a random conversation few months ago. Though I did not consider it but he stands by it even now. So I thought why don't I start a photo blog to share the random screens I capture in my daily routine.  
  
I used to share the same in [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/palaniraja) but it is not public and I locked for a reason. You can find my screenshot blog @ [http://qcfailed.tumblr.com](http://qcfailed.tumblr.com/)

Atlast, I finished my first verison of English to Tamil unicode convertor(Transliterater). What I planned to do was bit different than the one which is available now. Hope I will get the time to upgrade my unicode convertor( or Transliterater) to unique tool within a month. 

check the demo here : [xTamil](http://palani.bitsymphony.com/lab/xTamil/ "xTamil") 

Use IE if you are not sure whether you enabled unicode support in windows xp. To know How to enable unicode support please check here in [wikipedia](http://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Font_help#Windows_2000.2F_XP.2F_2003_Family "Enable unicode support")

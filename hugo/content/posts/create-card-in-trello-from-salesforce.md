Yes. [Danlec](https://github.com/danlec/Trello-Bookmarklet) already created a bookmarklet that lets you create Trello card from many services like Fogbugz, JIRA, Github and more. I forked his code and included the functionality to create card with salesforce case information.  
  

*   It allows you to create a card with Case Subject and description from case record.
*   If there is a recent comment (at least one comment) it will ignore the case description and copy the recent comment for card description.

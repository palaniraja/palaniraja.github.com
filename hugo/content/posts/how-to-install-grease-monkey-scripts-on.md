Chrome updated its policy to not to install extensions and scripts outside of Google webstore by default. (Gatekeeper, everyone wants to be the police)  
  
After using [Google reader](https://www.google.com/reader) without my [OSX lion](https://github.com/aziz/Google-Reader-Lion-UI) mod for over a week of frustration, I was motivated to find a solution. Know what! it is simpler than I thought.  
  
Drag and drop the file in [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions/) tab to install.  
  
 
 *   Download the extension file from the website and save it to your computer. 
 *   Click the wrench icon on the browser toolbar.
 *   Select Tools > Extensions.
 *   Locate the extension file on your computer and drag the file onto the Extensions page.
 *   Review the list of permissions in the dialog that appears. If you would like to proceed, click Install.

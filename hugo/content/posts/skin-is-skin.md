I'm very much disturbed after viewing the following video. 

[Youtube link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un1o5euw9aA) 

It is an excerpt of the documentary [Earthlings](http://http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358456/ "Earthlings 2003") watch it and share.

The truth is, if animals didn't exist... we would treat our fellow human beings the same way. Which is what happening now in most part of the world.

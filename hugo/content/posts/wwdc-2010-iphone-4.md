*   iPad didn't replace common tasks. Steve was referring his notepad on stage:). Old habits die hard.
*   Steve can still memorize 24 countries and repeat them in the same order. Bravo! Good job Steve.

*   Now the revenue will be sharedÂ  60-40%. 40% of iAd revenue to Apple.
*   Will FaceTime work if there are quite a few devices on the Wi-Fi network?
*   If FaceTime is Open, then H.264 and AAC too?
*   If the same front side glass was used in the back of iPhone 4, can we replace the backside glass for the front in case of damages to the front?
*   29$ for bumb ( a band covers the antennas'). Come on Steve, let the poor guys live with the iPhone/iPad cover business.
*   FaceTime is open since it use many OpenSource tools & standards.

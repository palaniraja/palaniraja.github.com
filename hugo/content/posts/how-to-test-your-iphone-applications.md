iPad can run most of the iPhone (iPod touch) applications. After installing the iPhone SDK 3.2 open your iPhone simulator and select below from the menu

**Hardware –> Versions –> 3.2** 

This will open your iPhone application in iPad simulator. By default the app will be open on the center of the iPad screen with ugly black border.

Not many of my ideas are converted to a project, this one has seen its light last week. Though I haven't completed all the UI and features of my original vision, it is better to have one working idea than nothing.

Please find the source of this extension @ [https://github.com/palaniraja/Tilethis](https://github.com/palaniraja/Tilethis)  
  
My original prototype for [Tilethis](http://dr-palaniraja.blogspot.com/2011/01/idea-vault-tile-this.html)

[Download v0.1](https://github.com/palaniraja/Tilethis/blob/master/extension/v0.1/Tile%20this.crx?raw=true) to try it yourself.  
  
  
#### Todo  
  

*   Display image dimension (Google extension sample "Get image info" is useful to study how to fetch dimension from image)
*   Make it work with images in the background (eg., div background)
*   Nice UI

Pull Requests are welcome.

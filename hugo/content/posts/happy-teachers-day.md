This is a post I'm meaning to write for a very long time. I wanted to write this every year around Teachers day ([5-Sep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Teachers%27_Days)) and failed to publish. Reason is, I could not find a way to express, anyhow here is an attempt.

I was a _bright(?)_ kid in school, but hated teachers, because I felt they don't know much other than the text books. As in everything in life, I learned very late the value of **Teaching** and no **one** knows everything. 

Happy Teachers Day to all my teachers. I'm deeply sorry for being a smug at times in classes. 

As they old phrase from this part of the world says _"Matha, Pitha, Guru & Deivam"_ (_Mother, Father, Teacher & God_). After your parents it is always the teacher(s) who shape us who we are. 

I am very thankful for my teachers. Not just teachers from my school and college, I thank every random strangers who writes a blog post explaining something they want to teach others, and Youtubers who publish valuable contents. 

I think of Teachers day as a Thanksgiving day for all the people who taught me everything I know. 

**Happy Teachers Day**.

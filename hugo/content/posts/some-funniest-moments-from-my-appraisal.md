I had my one-on-one meeting for 2012-13 appraisal this week. I was disappointed with the feedback given to me. Well, I have been _work_ing for very long time, and I know if you are not hurt then it is not an appraisal.  
We received a lo..ong email from my manager couple of days before the one-on-one meeting, explaining his expectations from resources. A week after we submitted our self appraisal. Though [unofficial first rule of appraisal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDqWAmvCf0o) is not to talk about appraisal, I couldn't help myself from posting this.  

* We have raised our bar, so no one get 4. (Points: 1-worst, 4-best)
* Discipline: 1 
    * Reason: I'm not available in office at 9am.
* Communication: 2 
    * Reason: My emails were always short, 3 to 5 sentences.
* Kaizen/continuous improvement/initiative and resourcefulness: 1 
    * Reason: You didn't participate in any kaizen/improvement or initiative
* Interpersonal skills: 2 
    * Reason: It is my honest feedback.
* I got three on other parameters.

### We have raised our bar

If no one get a 4, what is the point in keeping?  
  

### Discipline : I'm not available in office at 9am
Our official work hours starts at 9:30 and only handful of people (less than 5) including security  on the days I go early. I have asked is the only parameter? their answer was yes. They don't consider the fact my flexi-timing is actually 11:30 - 8:30 and I log 12+ hours a day  at least once a week. Also not ready to consider, I need to support both AUS and US (CST) client.  
I have explained my work timing numerous occasion, It is the way I could skip stupid traffic, and above all I ain't a morning person. On the days I go early I reach office at 8:00 and stay till 8:30.  
  

### Communication: My emails were always short, 3 to 5 sentences.

Yep, That is the only parameter. Oh! well, you don't use signature just name at the end.

*   Do you know sending a short email is the right way of doing it? 
*   Have you aware of [three.sentenc.es](http://three.sentenc.es/) or [five.sentenc.es](http://five.sentenc.es/)?
*   Any of my email were ambiguous?
*   Did you know I always send my vcard with all necessary info for the first time?
*   Do you know your signature breaks my search _has:attachment_ workflow?
*   Did you ever find an attachment when required within seconds while you are on a call?

### I didn't participate in any kaizen/improvement or initiative

*   Did you know anything about [Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)?
*   Are you aware that I was the one who get repositories created in org's [svn server](http://www.visualsvn.com/server/) and checks in code in whole of department?
*   Did you know I made sure the team know what is the use of SCM. And follow up with everyone  in team to ensure they check in code at least once a day? _Well, he did call me and asked what is SCM? when reviewing my self appraisal_ :-(
*   Did you know none of other team's code gets a backup anywhere except customer organisation?
*   Are you aware of the fact I created a portal for the team to share knowledge? in which you are admin and receive notification?
*   I share articles within team (mostly inexperienced programmers straight from college) about new technologies, productivity (libraries, scripts, automation)

### Interpersonal skills: It is my honest feedback

_"It is very subjective"_ was the feedback. They didn't point me the direction on where to improve. One other feedback is, I stop them abruptly when talking. Well, it is intentional; If I don't get what they (customer) was talking about, I stop people harping "_Yes, you are absolutely right_".  
  
One other incident this week, I was explaining benefits of native application over  mobile web. People on top of my food chain was saying native is not secure as we need to re-implement login and other security features, so it is better to go with the default features provided by salesforce. If it was not a conference call I could have stopped them and would have wrote "OAuth" on white board.

  

Writing about it more was actually a demotivating task, yet I did it. I may redirect this hate to write a [manifest for my imaginary startup](https://gist.github.com/palaniraja/5473887).

**Update**: Check the extension and more information @ [Idea to action: Tile thisÂ ]({{< ref "idea-to-action-tile-this.md" >}})  
  
I was recently hunting images for a sample design. I was trying to find a pattern that can be tiled/repeated to fill.  
  
I find it hard to copy an image to "define as a pattern" in Photoshop before applying "fill with pattern" to test whether the image can be tiled or not.  
  
As a web developer for ages, I've always used css property **_background-repeat: repeat-x | repeat-y | repeat_** to do similar tasks. Replacing image url to test the same with dummy html also a tedious task. So I have tried to see if there is an extension available to do this, unfortunately I couldn't find one. So here is my idea on how it can be done.

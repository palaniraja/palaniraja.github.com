One of my long time wish to write a Chrome extension completed last week. It all started when my answer was down-voted at [apple.stackexchange.com](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17229/is-there-a-way-i-can-import-readitlaters-exported-html-file-into-my-instapaper/), the original answer was based on my experience sometime ago I was searching to migrate my links between my Instapaper accounts.  
  
  
**How does it work?**  
  
It parses your exported *.html file for links and submit each items to Instapaper to add to your account.  

1.  Login to your [readitlaterlist.com](http://readitlaterlist.com/) in a new tab.
2.  Goto [http://readitlaterlist.com/export/](http://readitlaterlist.com/export/) to export all your links.
3.  Download and install [latest version](https://github.com/palaniraja/RIL2Insta/blob/master/extension/v0.2/RIL2Insta.crx?raw=true) of RIL2Insta from [Github](https://github.com/palaniraja/RIL2Insta/blob/master/extension/)
4.  Paste content of your exported file in the grey-textbox.
5.  Provide your Instapaper credentials and click _Post it for me._

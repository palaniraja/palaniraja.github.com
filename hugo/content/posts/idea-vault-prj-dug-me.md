Task management app with little twist. Yep, [Dug](http://pixar.wikia.com/Dug) instead of [clippy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant) while nagging.  
  
Idea is to log all our project ideas similar to logging notes in nvALT. This app runs in the background and randomly nag you to split a one line task you had logged earlier to multiple small tasks.  

  

For instance, consider the one line definition of a project is "Apple Ping Fail comic",  one fine day Dug will alert you to split the tasks if possible.

  

Then you add the task split as

*   Search for Steve jobs raging employees or on-stage image
*   Search for Ping sign up screen
*   Search image of confused people with registration form

Some time later Dug present one of a sub tasks to define no. of minutes required to complete the task. Say you add 15, 5 and 10 respectively. When you are idle on your computer, Dug will give you a random subtasks to take an action.  
  

#### Features

*   Add tasks (projects)
*   Add subtasks
*   Mark as complete
*   Define time required for tasks
*   View status (no. of times ignore button clicked against a task and so on)
*   Workflowy like tasks editing

**P.S**: I did replace Doug to Dug in post but text in images are hard to replace. So pretend it is [intentional](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/100) :-)

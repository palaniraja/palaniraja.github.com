Recently I was in need of generating sample images for no. of products in my db. I really hate to create a copy of image for each products in my db.  
  
I modified my previous [shell script]({{< ref "batch-renaming-of-files-mac-osx-nix.md" >}}) to automate the process of creating random images for given no. of product ids with relatively smaller no. of sample images.  

#### Output

```

shell$ sh randomImages.sh  
Completed generating 74 images from 5 sample images.  

```

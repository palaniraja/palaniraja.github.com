Angry Birds is one great app in Apple App Store that worth every penny (Full version is only $0.99)

I am not a great gamer, I give up on games too early. But this Angry Birds is one hell of a game (next to Road Rash & NFS II) that makes me addicted for a long time.

I am giving up now since I was not able to finish the levels. No cheats available only video walkthroughs :)  I wish the developer will release a Flash version of it to play from browsers (I was not able to find one).

Larry, if all these are because of [Steve's advice](http://www.edibleapple.com/2011/10/22/steve-jobs-advice-to-larry-page/). Learn one important attribute of Steve, [his ability to change his mind](http://opentothefuture.com/steve-jobs-changing-mind/). 


Kill products that are copycat of others (cough! cough! Google+). Whatever the efforts that went into recent changes of Google reader (Unified theme, Removing "Share" feature and add "+1" features) are the reasons why there was a decline in usage.

There are reasons why people don't use Facebook as their newsfeed and Google plus is not going to solve it. I have shared a lot of articles until you pulled the "share" feature from Google reader to integrate with [plus.google.com](http://plus.google.com/).

I've recently integrated [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) for an iOS app. Though I have heard it is very easy to integrate and lot of tutorials available, I could not find overall requirements/activities involved in integrating Apple Pay.  
  
I've documented my experience [DevDiary - Apple Pay](http://www.palaniraja.com/devdiary/ios/applepay/applepay.html).  
  
Eg., What are the components/steps involved and in chronological order/sequence. Trust me the image looked better in my mind than the output. Nonetheless I think it would be helpful to someone.

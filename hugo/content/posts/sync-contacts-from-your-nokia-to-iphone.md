It is possible to sync your contacts to your iPhone without MS Outlook? **Yes**.

### Steps

1.  Export your phonebook to CSV
2.  Import the same to your Gmail account
3.  Sync contacts from your Google account with iTunes.

### Notes:

*   In addition to Google, it is also possible to sync with Yahoo, windows address book, MS Outlook.
*   To export your phonebook you need Nokia PC suite. It doesn’t copy the SIM contacts; but the same can be imported directly in iPhone.

1\. Open your iTunes, select your iPhone and click the Info tab.

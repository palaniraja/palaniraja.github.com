Script speaks louder than words. Please go through the following links

**Jquery UI based Sticky page**

The first script is used to create a dynamic sticky image with the selected sticky pattern and font. 

The second script is an example to use the dynamic sticky to implement a sticky dashboard kindof application, it uses jquery UI for drag-n-drop feature. 

Script is almost 1 yr old so, with that said updates are welcome.

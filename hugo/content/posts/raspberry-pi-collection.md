I've always been interested in Raspberry Pi. I  pre-ordered, waited for about 3+ months and even paid Customs (ridiculous amount) to import my very first Pi. 

With my inability to afford my own computer pre work life made me crazy for computers. I find Raspberry Pi is a cheap way to fulfil it. I bought almost all Model B sometimes more than one.


I deployed so many OS version, tried several use cases - like Time-lapse camera, Google Assistance/Alexa for my car, Kodi media server and Pi hole for blocking ads. And also try unfamiliar OS once in 3 months, I am grateful it exists.

Here is a photo of my collection. It is not a complete collection, I did buy few accessories since the photo  :-)

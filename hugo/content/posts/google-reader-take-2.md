I was insanely angry with [Google's decision](http://dr-palaniraja.blogspot.in/2013/03/dont-kill-google-reader.html) still I am. Here are some stats from my Google Reader takeout data.  

*   Following 44 people
*   Followed by 31 people
*   690 Articles shared* with me
*   1017 Articles shared* by me
*   5657 Starred Articles

If you are people who think Social feed is replacing it, I promise you it never will. Reader is completely a different beast. I agree with [Führer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25VgNZDQ08) here. _Leave_.  
  

### Why I don't use Google+

\* URL: https://plus.google.com/100489225191991285746  - big random number?  
\* It is a Facebook clone.  
\* Vanity URL - +YourScreenname - Really?  
  
If you guys really want the people to use Google+. First task would be providing vanity URL to all. Even if they don't get _TheAwesomeUsername_ people would be happy to pick a screen name _BadAss2041AD_.  
  
I would suggest to take [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/)'s path of Social, when you decide to copy, copy a decent one. Merge your old [Blogger](http://blogger.com/) system with Google+ without breaking internet. No user would like to see a 404 page.

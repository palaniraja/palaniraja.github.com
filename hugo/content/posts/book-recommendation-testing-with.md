[TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (Test Driven Development) was introduced to me around 2006 with [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/index.html). As a naive, I couldn't see the benefits, eg., I saw the pattern of code has been updated very often (growing organically) and frequent failing test. I was like, _Why should I write unit test to test my own code? with the same data I used for manual testing?_ As they say I was seeing the forest for the trees. I failed to realize the failing test is actually the benefit of practicing TDD.  
  
I feel little embarrassed to admit that none of my projects followed unit testing or automated unit testing. Because of the kind of projects and technology I use in my day job. To clarify all my projects was always extensively tested but manually. "_The Specs_" are always in either comment or in commit logs.  
  
Nowadays, I'm trying to introduce unit testing, automation/continuos integration wherever possible. I'm still learning, but I get the big picture now.  
  
Though my only coffeescript was an [utility script](https://github.com/palaniraja/salesforce-id) which I wrote to test the water. I got a chance to read this book on a weekend, it is only 50+ pages long and it explains how to practice [BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (Behaviour driven development) with [Coffescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) framework.  
  
Did I say, the author Jack Franklin is only 20 years old? _Kids these days_ :-) It took half a decade and 20-year-old to put me to shame for not practicing TDD/BDD earlier.  
  
As they say, _When in doubt always test_.

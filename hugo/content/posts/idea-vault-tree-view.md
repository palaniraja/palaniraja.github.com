A Bookmarklet or a Browser extension to select the root element of a DOM (UL/OL) to view the Inverted tree structure of its child nodes.  
  
Due to usability issues in horizontal scrolling, we settled on Expand/Collapse Tree view design for almost all usecases. At times I find, it would be easier to understand if we can visualize the Expand/Collapse Tree view to traditional inverted tree structure.

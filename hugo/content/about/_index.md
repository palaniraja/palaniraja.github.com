In addition to whatever I mentioned in [Home](/); I am a [Post-Graduate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education) with specialization in Computer Science and Applications. 


I have been a software professional for more than 15 years. Other than software development, I'm also an ameture Photographer.

Writing "About me" is always a struggle, I guess you will know more about me from the site contents and links below.

Have a nice day!

I'm Palani raja, a programmer from [Chennai, India](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chennai,+Tamil+Nadu/ "Link to Google Maps"). 

This is still a draft site. I'll try to update it with information about my hobby projects and random stuff.

Recently, I've decided to merge all my content scattered across several different blogging systems into this site. If you notice anything broken, please feel free to email me.

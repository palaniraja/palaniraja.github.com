      <description>&lt;p&gt;I knew git had a feature to get change history of a method. I used it all the time with ObjC but it never worked for swift files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, you do not need this solution, unless you know for sure you have one too many build configs and it is time consuming to delete one by one. And the $ Trillion/Billion company do not find enginneers to assign multiple edits in scheme/buildconfig/simulator list in xcode UI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Whatchanged - Git history as HTML Report</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was requested to produce a report of changes in a git repo between two tags by testing team. I am not sure the basis of the request, as they can go through the git repo themselves. I also kind of thought it is better to have a separate report that can be uploaded to their release ticket for archival; instead of going through each commits between revisions or any changes to repo history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post I&amp;rsquo;m meaning to write for a very long time. I wanted to write this every year around Teachers day (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Teachers%27_Days&#34;&gt;5-Sep&lt;/a&gt;) and failed to publish. Reason is, I could not find a way to express, anyhow here is an attempt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I was fortunate to be a technical evaluator of an hackathon. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be vague here, as my company sponsored this event at a most reputed university of our state, Â this post is just my view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was cleaning up my mac before handing it to systems on my last job. I had a couple of days just for the Knowledge Transfer of projects and nothing else. I have always run two or three passive self policing apps like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rescuetime.com/&#34;&gt;Rescuetime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/free-time-tracker-timing-lite/id467410757?mt=12&#34;&gt;Timing&lt;/a&gt; etc.,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We received an unusual call at 4am on 6th only to know my Uncle and Aunt are no more. Suicide at the age of 70+ is not an easy decision, it has been a week and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t digest the news.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

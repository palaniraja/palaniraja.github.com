      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had my one-on-one meeting for 2012-13 appraisal this week. I was disappointed with the feedback given to me. Well, I have been _work_ing for very long time, and I know if you are not hurt then it is not an appraisal.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We received a lo..ong email from my manager couple of days before the one-on-one meeting, explaining his expectations from resources. A week after we submitted our self appraisal. Though &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDqWAmvCf0o&#34;&gt;unofficial first rule of appraisal&lt;/a&gt; is not to talk about appraisal, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself from posting this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I knew git had a feature to get change history of a method. I used it all the time with ObjC but it never worked for swift files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Script to delete xcode buildconfigurations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, you do not need this solution, unless you know for sure you have one too many build configs and it is time consuming to delete one by one. And the $ Trillion/Billion company do not find enginneers to assign multiple edits in scheme/buildconfig/simulator list in xcode UI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Whatchanged - Git history as HTML Report</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was requested to produce a report of changes in a git repo between two tags by testing team. I am not sure the basis of the request, as they can go through the git repo themselves. I also kind of thought it is better to have a separate report that can be uploaded to their release ticket for archival; instead of going through each commits between revisions or any changes to repo history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve started in Jan &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/palaniraja/devdiary/commits/master&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;. This is to practice a habit of keeping a log of stuff I do which took me a lot of time to figure out myself (may be I&amp;rsquo;m not efficient?).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Recommended Git workflow</title>
      <link>https://www.palaniraja.com/2011/06/recommended-git-workflow/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/871/why-is-git-better-than-subversion&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; as my revision control tool. Impressed by the use of branching and merging, I create and merge a lot of branches. Our company use SVN and other peers were not aware/interested in &lt;a href=&#34;http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;. So I took the initiative to use svn-git. After months of progress I left with so many branches for features, svn, QA-release and quick-fix for released builds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <p>Last weekend I was fortunate to be a technical evaluator of an hackathon. Yes, I&rsquo;m trying to be vague here, as my company sponsored this event at a most reputed university of our state,  this post is just my view.</p>

<p>There were 9 team participated out of which 3 teams dropped off and only 5 were presented at the end of 48 hour hackathon.</p>

<p>The funny thing is organizers of this programme was surprised that the students are completely prepared, I heard they didn&rsquo;t raise any question at the end of our opening speech. Their only worry was which of their idea can be executed within the given time which was a surprise for our team.</p>

<p>All of their ideas are good, though I was aware of similar apps, I didn&rsquo;t share any of my feedback as I thought it might demotivate them as I only joined at the end of the hackathon. One of the team was thinking they are having next billion dollar idea, and they were referring themselves as a competitor to a famous site of their domain. I happen to agree, if they pitch to right people they could definitely make few millions.</p>

<p>Kids are between 2nd-4th year of CS background. One of the team people actually left for like 4 hrs to participate in another programme. All of the participates already secured a 6 digit income per month :-)</p>

<p>I was really impressed by their talents especially the knowledge of tools. All of them aware of native/hybrid mobile development and right framework. For eg., most of them developed app using <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery mobile</a> and <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> to package, <a href="https://codiqa.com/">codiqa</a> to get the UI up and running, and their knowledge in the plugins one of the team actually published their plugin in <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. Another team started with a <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/creating-style-guides">style guide</a>, only few of my project starts with a branding guidelines in my decade old professional experience.</p>

<p>If I own a time machine and I&rsquo;ll travel back in time to kick myself in the butt for not getting high scores which could have changed my life. What can I say, I was, and still is a day dreamer.</p>

<p>I had my one-on-one meeting for 2012-13 appraisal this week. I was disappointed with the feedback given to me. Well, I have been _work_ing for very long time, and I know if you are not hurt then it is not an appraisal.<br />
We received a lo..ong email from my manager couple of days before the one-on-one meeting, explaining his expectations from resources. A week after we submitted our self appraisal. Though <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDqWAmvCf0o">unofficial first rule of appraisal</a> is not to talk about appraisal, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself from posting this.</p>

<ul>
<li>We have raised our bar, so no one get 4. (Points: 1-worst, 4-best)</li>
<li>Discipline: 1

<ul>
<li>Reason: I&rsquo;m not available in office at 9am.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Communication: 2

<ul>
<li>Reason: My emails were always short, 3 to 5 sentences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kaizen/continuous improvement/initiative and resourcefulness: 1

<ul>
<li>Reason: You didn&rsquo;t participate in any kaizen/improvement or initiative</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpersonal skills: 2

<ul>
<li>Reason: It is my honest feedback.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I got three on other parameters.

<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="we-have-raised-our-bar">We have raised our bar</h3>

<p>If no one get a 4, what is the point in keeping?</p>

<h3 id="discipline-i-m-not-available-in-office-at-9am">Discipline : I&rsquo;m not available in office at 9am</h3>

<p>Our official work hours starts at 9:30 and only handful of people (less than 5) including security  on the days I go early. I have asked is the only parameter? their answer was yes. They don&rsquo;t consider the fact my flexi-timing is actually 11:30 - 8:30 and I log 12+ hours a day  at least once a week. Also not ready to consider, I need to support both AUS and US (CST) client.<br />
I have explained my work timing numerous occasion, It is the way I could skip stupid traffic, and above all I ain&rsquo;t a morning person. On the days I go early I reach office at 8:00 and stay till 8:30.</p>

<h3 id="communication-my-emails-were-always-short-3-to-5-sentences">Communication: My emails were always short, 3 to 5 sentences.</h3>

<p>Yep, That is the only parameter. Oh! well, you don&rsquo;t use signature just name at the end.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you know sending a short email is the right way of doing it? </li>
<li>Have you aware of <a href="http://three.sentenc.es/">three.sentenc.es</a> or <a href="http://five.sentenc.es/">five.sentenc.es</a>?</li>
<li>Any of my email were ambiguous?</li>
<li>Did you know I always send my vcard with all necessary info for the first time?</li>
<li>Do you know your signature breaks my search <em>has:attachment</em> workflow?</li>
<li>Did you ever find an attachment when required within seconds while you are on a call?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="i-didn-t-participate-in-any-kaizen-improvement-or-initiative">I didn&rsquo;t participate in any kaizen/improvement or initiative</h3>

<ul>
<li>Did you know anything about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Test</a>?</li>
<li>Are you aware that I was the one who get repositories created in org&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.visualsvn.com/server/">svn server</a> and checks in code in whole of department?</li>
<li>Did you know I made sure the team know what is the use of SCM. And follow up with everyone  in team to ensure they check in code at least once a day? <em>Well, he did call me and asked what is SCM? when reviewing my self appraisal</em> :-(</li>
<li>Did you know none of other team&rsquo;s code gets a backup anywhere except customer organisation?</li>
<li>Are you aware of the fact I created a portal for the team to share knowledge? in which you are admin and receive notification?</li>
<li>I share articles within team (mostly inexperienced programmers straight from college) about new technologies, productivity (libraries, scripts, automation)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interpersonal-skills-it-is-my-honest-feedback">Interpersonal skills: It is my honest feedback</h3>

<p><em>&ldquo;It is very subjective&rdquo;</em> was the feedback. They didn&rsquo;t point me the direction on where to improve. One other feedback is, I stop them abruptly when talking. Well, it is intentional; If I don&rsquo;t get what they (customer) was talking about, I stop people harping &ldquo;<em>Yes, you are absolutely right</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>One other incident this week, I was explaining benefits of native application over  mobile web. People on top of my food chain was saying native is not secure as we need to re-implement login and other security features, so it is better to go with the default features provided by salesforce. If it was not a conference call I could have stopped them and would have wrote &ldquo;OAuth&rdquo; on white board.</p>

<p>Writing about it more was actually a demotivating task, yet I did it. I may redirect this hate to write a <a href="https://gist.github.com/palaniraja/5473887">manifest for my imaginary startup</a>.</p>

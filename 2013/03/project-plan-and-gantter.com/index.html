<p>Project planning is always a difficult task for me. I could do anything to skip the project planning because for following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I know right away I am not going to meet the deadline, regardless of time provided.</li>
<li>Splitting the tasks to be developer friendly, without modifying the timeline promised to client by sales is very hard.</li>
<li>The tasks breakdown provided at the time of proposal is never the same. </li>
<li>Introduce milestone to match the target revenue set for the subsequent months by your division.</li>
<li>And I hate anything related to Money (Revenue/Commercials)</li>
</ul>

<p>For some reasons I always end up as a Technical lead who does everything related to project /people management in addition to actual development. It has been the same in all the companies I worked so far. Though I know it is good for me in career, every time, I think it is a Project managers&rsquo; responsibility and they are delegating. I do them with cursing every minute.</p>

<p>This past week, I was assigned to prepare a plan for a new project. We don&rsquo;t use MS Project and the Excel format which we use is not very helpful If I miss a non-working day or any modification of tasks to be done in middle of planning. Since I hate it, i was procrastinating happily in finding alternatives. </p>

<p>--- ✄ &mdash;</p>

<p><a href="https://app.gantter.com/">Gantter.com</a> is in my bookmarks for long time, though I didn&rsquo;t use it heavily I thought I had give a try. After spending 3+ hours with it, I kind of liked it. It is far better than MS Project whatever the version I used long ago. </p>

<p>As a true developer and <a href="http://qcfailed.tumblr.com/">a person who notice everything</a>, I also jolted few features that could improve this tool a lot. They do support extensions and I&rsquo;m yet to explore the documentation. Hopefully someone could implement the following features someday.</p>

<ul>
<li>Modify/Assign resources for multiple tasks?</li>
<li>Keyboard friendly Predecessors </li>
<li>An autocomplete text/dropdown with <code>{Id}-{Task Title}</code> eg., <code>2 - Wireframe internal review</code></li>
<li>Option to view just the duration of filtered resource?</li>
<li>Filter tasks for more than one resource</li>
<li>Export to Excel? (just as values should be a good start)</li>
<li>Calendar - Marking non-working days could be easier</li>
<li>Tasks properties Dialog</li>
<li>In addition it could have <code>{Id}-{Task Title}</code> in the title.</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="modify-assign-resources-for-multiple-tasks">Modify/Assign resources for multiple tasks?</h3>

<p>Right now, you had to manually click each task row and select a resource to assign. This could be simplified, by providing a multi check options to update resource and their utilisations for multiple tasks?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.palaniraja.com/assets/assign-resources.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="keyboard-friendly-predecessors">Keyboard friendly Predecessors </h3>

<p>The same for Predecessor, I agree if you have more resource you don&rsquo;t include a constrain of completion date for previous task as Finish-to-start for every item. But my issue here is not a multiple update. But have an autocomplete text or a drop down to easily select the predecessor.</p>

<p>Or you could go crazy like Xcode4/Interface Builder or Omnigraffle like joining tool.</p>

<h3 id="option-to-view-just-the-duration-of-filtered-resource">Option to view just the duration of filtered resource?</h3>

<p>When you filter by resource, the total hours displayed are not the sum of hours for the resource.  It is the same as the complete plan.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.palaniraja.com/assets/filtered-Dev1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://www.palaniraja.com/assets/no---filter.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="filter-tasks-for-more-than-one-resource">Filter tasks for more than one resource</h3>

<p>If you provide option to filter tasks for multiple resources say I would like to know the tasks assigned for <em>Dev1, Dev2</em> in case of development and <em>Tester1, Tester2</em> to know my test schedules.</p>

<h3 id="export-to-excel">Export to Excel?</h3>

<p>One thing I learnt in my experience is all bosses would like to see the plan in Excel. Trust me, I wrote a project time sheet management tool with <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">Google Apps Script</a>. My VP approved this crazy idea because they can just view their data in a spreadsheet. </p>

<p>As of now Gantter doesn&rsquo;t allow multiline copy. Right now, I use a workaround, <strong>Project -&gt; Printable HTML</strong> and copy the content to <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime text</a>, and do a <em>Find &amp; Replace</em> to get the tasks list.</p>

<h3 id="calendar-marking-non-working-days-could-be-easier">Calendar - Marking non-working days could be easier</h3>

<p>All you have to do to mark a working day as holiday/non-working day, you need to goto a calendar properties. Select a date and clear the working time. This is not very friendly, it would be cool, if I enter/key in series of days to be ignored in planning.</p>

<h3 id="tasks-properties-dialog">Tasks properties Dialog</h3>

<p>Refer the image, it would be immensely helpful to know which task is getting updated. I&rsquo;m not sure whether it is a bug, I see the task list in the plan is scrolled to bottom. May be I was having a FS constraint at the bottom related to the particular task, but it was annoying, to click the General tab to know which tasks I&rsquo;m correctly looking at. </p>

<p><img src="https://www.palaniraja.com/assets/Task-dialog-title.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts </h3>

<p>Because of Google, I can&rsquo;t live without keyboard shortcuts. It is also a reason why I can&rsquo;t switch to Feedly like everyone else.</p>

<p>If you provide  keyboard bindings for Task properties dialog to switch between the tabs or the fields, it would be helpful.</p>

<p>The current plan is not an exhaustive list of tasks (around 120+ line items). Still I think Gantter could be more helpful with the suggested features.</p>
